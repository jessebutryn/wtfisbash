# WTFisBASH?

This repository is a place for me to store reference materials, examples, guides, etc.  The purpose of this repository
is to maintenance an easily referenced and concise aggregation of bash related knowledge that I would otherwise
certainly forget.

## Recommended Resources

This is just a list of my favorite places to obtain information about bash scripting

* [Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)
  * This is *the* authoritative reference for anything bash related.  They made it after all.  It is also extremely easy
  to ready from start to finish.
* [Bash Pitfalls](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls)
  * You should read this entire page twice before writing any script that will be run in production.
* [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)
  * Another great resource.  Includes lots of examples.
* [Shell & Utilities](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2016edition/utilities/contents.html)
  * This resource is written specifically for `sh` however it includes many useful lessons still relevant to bash and
  other utilities one would use in a bash script.
* [The GNU Awk User's Guide](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html)
  * While `awk` is a separate programming language altogether, being proficient with it's use will certainly improve
  the functionality and performance of your bash scripts.
* [U&L Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/)
  * This site has become the default catch-all for bash related questions.  While they can also be posted on
  stack overflow, I believe that U&L is a much better resource for bash/shell scripting.

another spot to put them in.
